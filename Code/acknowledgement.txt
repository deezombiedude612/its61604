First of all, we would like take this opportunity to express our heartfelt gratitude to our lecturer, Dr. Safraz Nawaz Brohi who has relentlessly and tirelessly assisted us in completing this assignment. He had given us support and insight in doing this project and have patiently listened and guided us.

It is to our advantage that we have received help and support from our friends, especially our course mates and seniors to clear our doubts when completing this assignment. It is our greatest thanks and joy that we have met these wonderful people. Thank you.

Last but not least, we would like to express our sincerest thanks to the most important people of our life, our parents and siblings who have showered us with lots and love and support throughout the way in completing this assignment. Their confidence in us has given us the strength and courage to be the best in everything we do.

Thanks a million!
